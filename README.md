## Inspiration
Aptos does not have sdk in c# language, but I found that it can be realized with some tools.
I use [puerts](https://github.com/Tencent/puerts) and [puerts-cli](https://github.com/sbfkcel/puerts_cli) to make aptos typescript sdk running in unity.

Through these tools, you can also obtain the ability of hot update/fix in Unity app.
